Welcome to our repository of resources for the Vantiv Money2020 2016 Hackathon Challenge.

To learn more about Cubelets and how to get started, please see our page [Cubelets Page on Vantiv O.N.E.] (https://developer.vantiv.com/community/hackathon/money2020/pages/cubelets)

This challenge centers around creating a useful solution involving Cubelets and payments using Vantiv's eCommerce API.

Vantiv's eCommerce API is a simple XML-based HTTPS POST API accessible from any internet connected device.

You can [read a quick primer here] (https://developer.vantiv.com/docs/DOC-1851) to get started.

A few sample C language programs that run on Cubelets are included as samples. You can use the Cubelets Flash tool to run these code examples on individual Cubelets.
